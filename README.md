# Terraform AWS CodeBuild Project with Webhook

This Terraform module provisions an AWS CodeBuild Runner project with an attached webhook. Currently, AWS does not support creating Runner Project via API or cli commands. This module is a workaround. Basically, terraform code creates a default project but on applying certain webhooks, it saves the project as Runner project instead of default project. This modules is useful for any team that wants to run their github actions on AWS provided on-demand compute.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- A Github app "AWS Connector for GitHub" successfully installed and configured with an AWS account. [More info on that](https://qnetconfluence.cms.gov/display/ISFCS/Github+Runners+on+CodeBuild).
- CodeConnection itself can be provisioned by terraform but need a manual step of authorizing it from AWS account. Module will fail if it is not authorized.


## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ Provisions a CodeBuild Runner project using GitHub as the source (via CodeConnections)
- üì¶ Adds default filter groups to capture key events (indirectly creates a runner project without official support)
- ‚ûï Supports additional user-supplied filter groups
- üß† Automatically configures `scope_configuration` when applicable (i.e. webhook access repo level vs org level)
- By default, module provisions the compute type as Lambda with 2 GB memory. linux OS and Node.js runtime

## üì¶ Module Usage Examples

### Example 1: Access level: Repo, Compute: EC2, Running Mode: Container

```tf
module "codebuild_project" {
  source = "git@github.com:flexion/aws-codebuild-runner-project-tf-module.git?ref=1.0.0"

  name                     = "my-codebuild-project"
  description              = "Builds on workflow events"
  build_timeout            = 10
  service_role_arn         = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/codebuild-role"
  // Running mode
  environment_type         = "LINUX_CONTAINER"
  // Compute Type: EC2
  environment_compute_type = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"
  // Image: EC2 AMI Image
  environment_image        = "aws/codebuild/amazonlinux-x86_64-standard:5.0"
  // As the access level is repo; remote repo address
  source_location          = "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo"
  codeconnections_arn      = "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/abc123"
  // github_org_name          = "my-org"  Only needed if the webhook access level is org level; will be ignored if source_location != "CODEBUILD_DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_SOURCE_LOCATION"
}
```

### Example 2: Access level: Org, Compute: Lambda, Running Mode: Container, Memory: 4GB

```tf
module "codebuild_project" {
  source = "git@github.com:flexion/aws-codebuild-runner-project-tf-module.git?ref=1.0.0"

  name                     = "my-codebuild-project"
  description              = "Builds on workflow events"
  build_timeout            = 10
  service_role_arn         = aws_iam_role.codebuild-exec-role.arn
  // All environment variable defaults except Memory
  environment_compute_type = "BUILD_LAMBDA_4GB"
  // As the access level is org; source_location must be CODEBUILD_DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_SOURCE_LOCATION (this is default as well)
  // source_location          = "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo"
  codeconnections_arn      = aws_codeconnections_connection.private-code-connection.arn
  github_org_name          = "my-org"
}
```

### Example 3: Access level: repo, Compute: use module defaults, additional webhook to not start build when repo name starts with test

```tf
module "codebuild_project" {
  source = "git@github.com:flexion/aws-codebuild-runner-project-tf-module.git?ref=1.0.0"

  name                     = "my-codebuild-project"
  description              = "Builds on workflow events"
  build_timeout            = 10
  service_role_arn         = aws_iam_role.codebuild-exec-role.arn
  // All environment variable defaults
  // As the access level is not org; source_location must be a repo name
  source_location          = "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo"
  codeconnections_arn      = aws_codeconnections_connection.private-code-connection.arn

   additional_filter_groups = [
    [  
      {  
        type    = "EVENT"
        pattern = "PUSH"
      },
      {  
        type    = "REPOSITORY_NAME"
        pattern = "test-*"
        exclude_matched_pattern = true
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## üß© Default Filter Groups

This default filter group is the core logic on provisioning a runner project. As AWS natively does not support to provision a Codebuild runner project yet; this webhook configuration indrectly transforms a codebuild default project to a codebuild runner project

```tf
[ # group 1
  {
    type    = "EVENT"
    pattern = "WORKFLOW_JOB_QUEUED"
  }
]
```

- The module always adds one default filter group (to create a runner project).
- If you provide additional_filter_groups, they are appended after the defaults.
- In the additional filter groups, at least one filter of type = "EVENT" is required per filter group by AWS (see example 3).
- exclude_matched_pattern is optional and defaults to false when not supplied.
- scope_configuration is added only when source_location == "CODEBUILD_DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_SOURCE_LOCATION" or is not provided at all (module default).
